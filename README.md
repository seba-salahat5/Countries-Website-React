This Project is created as a part of frontend training at Harri Technologies
The web app contains two pages (home, details)
- The home page displays all the countries fetched from the API as cards, with search, filter, and drag & drop actions.
- The details page appears by clicking on one of the countries' cards to display its details.

This project is similar to the country's website project but this time is implemented using ReactJS.
Here we focus on:
- Component-based architecture
- single source of truth
- modularity
- functional programming methodology
- using React Hooks
- using Context API
- react router dom library
